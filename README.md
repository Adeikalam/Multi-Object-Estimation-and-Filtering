# Multi-Object Estimation and Filtering
 
Practical Assignement for the Multi-Object Estimation and Filtering course by Daniel CLARK.

The aim of this assignement was to implement filtering techniques such as:

- Kalman Filter and Gaussian Sum Filter for single target tracking
- Gaussian PHD filter for multi-target tracking.

I have also implemented trajectory and observation simulators in order to test these algorithms.
